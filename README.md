# GifTastic

GifTastic is a simple app which uses the giphy API to show gifs from the giphy.com site. The top level
of the site hierarchy contains the root html and php files. The css and javascript folders located in the
assets folder contain the app's css and javascript respectively. External imports are made of the resources
required for the Google Materialize css framework.
